General lighting terms:

L = Light vector from the surface
N = normal on the surface
V = Normal on the point in the direction towards viewer
H = Half vector, microfacet approximiatin

#1 Diffuse lightining
-> Absorbation and then reflected globally across all.
   -> No view dependancy(its spread all across)
   -> Albeldo * light color (l dot n)
   	-> The irridance ( amount of light that hits the object ) is important as if you hit it with an angle vs straight forwards leads to different amount of irradiance hitting the object

#2 Specular lighting
-> Physical pheonom(Fresnel)
-> Each material have a refraction (Amount of specular usage).
	-> In our code called substance.
-> Its view depdant, where more of the light directly reflects at the impact point of light (the one we are attempting to render)
	-> Example:
		-> Looking down straight down on water (no specular lightining almost), you see the stones.
		-> Look at horizon, you see a bunch of specular lighthtning and less of the diffuse lightning part.
	-> Materials judge the amount of specular reflectence (substance)
		-> Metals reflect a lot and have high specular intensity.
-> Schlik is used to approximate specular best:

-> Roughness
	-> Materials have different sets, we need to model this.
		-> We use a thing called Microfacets
		-> Need to figure out how many microfacets reflect into us.
		-> For this we use a halfway vector. Its the H = normalize(L + V).
		-> We calculate the angle between H and N to determine the amount of microfacets that look towards the viewer.
			-> Smaller 0 means more microfacets.	
		-> Formula for distrubution
			-> ρ(θh)	=	cosm(θh)
			M being the roughness. (Depedant on the amount of roughnes)
		-> We use normalization equation
